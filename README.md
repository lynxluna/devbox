# A DevBox

This will startup minikube and vagrant consul machines for now. You'd need these
software to be installed first:

  - Vagrant
  - VirtualBox

## Running

First timer, you can execute the `bootstrap.sh` file:

```console
./bootstrap.sh
```

If you want to re-provision, just use Vagrant and minikube commands.
